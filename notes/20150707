In the morning  tried to reproduce Sasha's error message
    - can now use ant to compile entire project
    - can now use make file to compile elki library
    
In the afternoon had meeting with Sandhya/Sasha about RDD
    - promise to figure out what leads to Java heap error
    - send invitation to iftekah to use my cluster
    - move /tmp to localdisk 

In the evening set up Windows debugging mode in intellij for hadoop
    - can run wordcount example just fine
    - successfully formatted hdfs for standalone cluster  ( do not save file to 
    anyplace with space in path name)

TODO:
Put input file into windows hdfs and debug the hadoop knnjoin code
