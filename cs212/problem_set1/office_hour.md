1. How do you measure a code is of a good taste after it does the right thing?
    English does a good job communicating information.
    If your code is close to English, then it is clear/concise.
    Too long may fail communicating too short can also fail communicating.
    Too long will bore reders, too short often lack context. 
    So need to learn just the right length to communicate to your reader (Yourself/Colleague). 

2. How much time you spend research existing method / write your own?
    For basic building blocks like string int etc. Need to lean how to use. 
    FOr large things like server/email, someone else may have done it, try find it. 

3. Top down / Bottom up?
    Depends on what is clear / understanding.
    When you know domain more, can start from top. 
    When you do not know very clear, form bottom up. 
    But always can wish "if only I have a function that does this" and move on then come back. Should alwasy try to do this.
